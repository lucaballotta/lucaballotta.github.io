I've been working on a bunch of topics, mostly related to network control and multi-agent systems.
Recently, I've started to work on fault detection and safety of control systems.

<h2> Resilient multi-agent systems </h2>

<b><i>Disclaimer:</i></b> Resilience is arguably one of the most (ab)used keywords recently. Not my fault, though, so I'll just be consistent with the literature.

In multi-agent systems, 
<b>resilient control</b> makes "normal" agents cooperate and collaborate while interacting with "misbehaving" agents that, well, just do what they want.

My research works along two directions.
The first is to design resilient algorithms with <b>flexible performance guarantees</b>: that is,
they should not only drive normal agents to some desired behavior,
but also quantify how good (or bad) the situation is going to be,
without relying on strict assumptions.
The second is to leverage physics-based sources of information,
such as the wireless channel,
to obtain <b>trustworthiness indications</b> of agents based on their transmitted data and in turn to detect adversaries.

<h2> Processing networks </h2>

Processing networks are wonderful beasts where interconnected smart sensors collect, process, and exchange data to fulfill a task.
Prominents examples are <b>smart cameras for surveillance,
environmental sensors for pollution monitoring,
teams of mobile robots,
Internet-of-Things devices,
and autonomous vehicles</b>.
Smart sensors have limited computation and communication resources which need to be wisely allocated to optimize performance.
This challenge is exhancerbated when dealing with networks of heterogeneous smart sensors.

My research investigates <b>optimal codesing under resource constraints</b> such as computation and transmission delays and limited power consumption,
with a twofold focus:
to develop <b>tailored models</b> of smart sensors under realistic conditions,
and to devise <b>codesign algorithms</b> for optimal performance and resource allocation.

My next step will be to add TinyML to the picture: if you'd like to collaborate, shoot me an email!
